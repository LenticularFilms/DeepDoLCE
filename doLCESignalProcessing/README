1. How to install
- place all files into a directory (e.g. /home/XY/Programs/doLCE )
- open a terminal in this directory and build the program from the shell by running 'make' and then 'make install' in that directory, the latter requires root priviledge)
- run the program from the shell by 'doLCE'


2. intended purpose
- reconstruct color stills from gray level scans of lenticular film material (Kodacolor, ...)


3. ideas of software (concept):
 0. No additional comments, aim is to have the code itself understandable 
 1. new_...() only allocates memory, values are not set
 2. new_..() operates only if data containing arrays point to NULL
 3. delete_...() releases memory and sets pointers on data containing fields to NULL
 4. methods do not allocate or release memory (reentrance safe?)
 5. pixel coordinates are ordered as in mathematics: x,y
 6. using a memState_objectXY varibale to keep track of allocation and freeing memory in the main() is advised!
 7. return value 0 <-> OK, other <-> ERROR
 8. methods only report in case of problems, they are quiet in case of success (main() shall decide when to report success) 
 
The code is based on the one used for the "Monolith 2" project conducted IML, University of Basel. Although there the "y,x" order for pixel coordinates is used. Hence the code here is an extensively reorganized version of that code.
